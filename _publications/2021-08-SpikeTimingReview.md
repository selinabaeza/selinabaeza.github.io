Abstract:
Primary vestibular neurons are categorized as either regularly or irregularly firing afferents that use rate and temporal sensory encoding strategies, respectively. While many factors influence firing in these neurons, recent work in mammalian vestibular afferents has demonstrated a rich diversity in ion channels that drive spiking regularity. Here, I review key ionic currents studied in vitro and demonstrate how they may enable sensory encoding strategies demonstrated in vivo.
