**_hi and welcome_**

I'm a PhD Candidate in the Committee on Neurobiology at the University of Chicago. I work in the laboratory of [Dr. Ruth Anne Eatock](https://voices.uchicago.edu/eatocklab/). Previously, I completed my BA in Cognitive Sciences and Spanish, with a minor in Neuroscience, at Rice University (go Owls). My primary scientific interest is the neurobiology of sensory transduction and encoding: 
(1) how do the properties of sensory receptors mold our perceptual experiences, 
(2) what are the key biophysical properties that they need to do so, and 
(3) how is information encoded? 
These are the questions that keep me up at night. That, and what's for breakfast.

The peripheral vestibular system is a great model for studying fundamental questions in sensation. Primary vestibular afferents, and their presynaptic hair cells, are an arguably underrated yet beautiful example of sensory transmission where the encoding of a vast range of sensory information can be traced down to  their physiological characteristics. Vestibular hair cells are delectably sensitive, transducing mere nanometers of displacement. They synapse onto vestibular afferents, which carry information to the vesitublar brain stem to drive life saving reflexes. Information in this system is represented in two distinct yet parallel streams that use different sensory encoding strategies to convey complementing signals. This system is known to use both rate and temporal encoding to transmit swift, precise, and accurate information of head motion frequencies across various orders of mangitude. Incredibly (and I mean, _incredibly_),this difference in sensory encoding strategy is driven in large part by the composition of diverse ion channels expressed in these afferents. This is what I'm talking about: these are the key biophsyical properties that allow us to sense and perceive head motion. Vestibular encoding has been studied in fish, frogs, turtles, chicks and pigeons, mice, rats, chincillas, squirrel monkeys, spider monkeys, macaques, humans, etc. etc. etc. What are *you* waiting for? Drink the vestibular kool-aid. 

 _Saludos_.
