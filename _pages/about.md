**_hi and welcome_**

I am a PhD Candidate in the Committee on Neurobiology at the University of Chicago. I work in the laboratory of Dr. Ruth Anne Eatock. Previously, I completed my BA in Cognitive Sciences and Spanish, with a minor in Neuroscience, at Rice University. My scientific interests are primarily the neurobiology of sensory transduction and encoding. The peripheral vestibular system is a great model for studying fundamental questions in sensation. In my research, I study the role that diverse voltage-gated sodium currents play in different in firing pattern found in vestibular ganglion neurons (VGN). Using isolated VGN from mice, I investigate transient, persistent and resurgent sodium currents and how they influence spiking excitability using patch clamp electrophysiology and computational modeling techniques. Good stuff.

Thanks for your patience as I find the time to populate this site. Saludos.
